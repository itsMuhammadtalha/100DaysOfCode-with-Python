## DataTypes 

 Python has a wide variety of built-in datatypes, including:

- Numbers: integers, floats, complex numbers
- Strings: Unicode (UTF-8)
- Lists
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionaries
- Booleans
- Files
- Custom classes

## Operators

Python has a variety of operators that are used to perform operations on values and variables. The most common operators are the arithmetic operators, which are used to perform basic mathematical operations on numbers. Other operators include comparison operators, logical operators, bitwise operators, assignment operators, and membership operators.

### Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers. These include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), floor division (//), modulus (%) and exponent (**). These operators can be used on both integers and floating point numbers.

## Typecasting
In Python, typecasting is the process of converting one data type to another. This is done with the help of built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc. These functions help us to convert a value from one data type to another.
### Types of Typecasting
1. Implicit Typecasting: In Implicit typecasting, Python automatically converts one data type to another data type.  This process doesn't need any user involvement. 

2. Explicit Typecasting: In Explicit Typecasting, users convert the data type of an object to required data type. We use predefined functions like int(), float(), str(), etc to perform explicit typecasting. 

3. Widening Typecasting: Widening typecasting is also known as upcasting. It is a type of typecasting which converts lower data type to higher data type.

4. Narrowing Typecasting: Narrowing typecasting is also known as downcasting. It is a type of typecasting which converts higher data type to lower data type.
